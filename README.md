## ‚öôÔ∏è Customizations

### Home Page
Your home page consist of 3 sections: intro, content and features.

##### Home Intro (home-intro)
In this section, bro theme utilizes your site config.toml file to populate content. 
- `description` Title of the intro section
- `hero_description` Paragraph within the hero section
- `hero_button_label` Text on the button in intro section, if you don't provide this field, there won't be any button on home intro
- `hero_button_link` The URL that the button will point to

#### Home Content (home-content)

This section rendered if you set up a home content. (Create an index_md in your content root)

#### Features(home-features)

Use following fields to configure your feature list.

- `features_title`  If you don't have the features title, features section is not rendered
- `features_subtitle` Sub title for the feature section

You need to provide an array of features as follows;

**Example**:
```
[[params.features]]
image = "/img/idea.svg"
title = "Ideation and Analysis"
description = "At Ally Bros, we constantly ideate and try to find solutions for daily life problems, perform analysis of feasibility and market."
```
### Section pages
Section pages can behave in two different ways, portfolio listing or content listing. This is controlled by existence of `portfolio = true` in your sections pagefront field.

### Content pages
Content pages can behave in two different ways, depending on existince of `appIcon` on your post pagefront, you will get a card that uses following fields;

- `sourceCodeLink`, `storeLink` and `externalLink` controls the buttons and their urls.
- `appIcon` is the logo for the content, which appears both on the portfolio and left side of the card.
